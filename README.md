# 9103_FinalProject
 creating prototype for selected artwork "untitled"


## Inspirations

When looking at this artwork, at first, i was thinking about drawing parallelgrams. And then i realized the similarity between this artwork and the product codes, which are made of straight lines. 

Since all the lines in this artwork are parallel, except for several gray lines, I could make a class for the basic line in each group, setting its angle, start point and end points. And i can use for loops to pile lines together, to form parallelgrams. In this way, the shape and color of different sections can be manipulated more precises, adding details to the representation of this artwork.

I decided to give this method a try.
